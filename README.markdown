#StackKit

StackKit is a Cocoa framework used to interact with the Stack Overflow API (used by [Stack Overflow][1], [Super User][2] and [Server Fault][3] and [Stack Exchange][4] websites).

It is developed by [Dave DeLong][5], and [Alex Rozanski][6].

##Current Progress

We are currently implementing the official API.  The progress is slow, so it is unlikely that it is actually usable.  If you would like to contribute, PLEASE HELP!

##Using the API

In order to use the framework, you will need to acquire an [API Key][7] and save it as a file called "consumerKey.txt" in the root level of your clone.

##The future

As the API is released and updated by the Stack Overflow team, we will be able to provide an underlying StackKit implementation for such features.
