#StackKit

StackKit is a Cocoa framework used to interact with the Stack Overflow API (used by [Stack Overflow][1], [Super User][2] and [Server Fault][3] and [Stack Exchange][4] websites).

It is developed by [Dave DeLong][5], and [Alex Rozanski][6].

##Current Progress

We are currently implementing the beta official API.  As of right now, only a few features are usable, mainly fetching an SKUser object.

##The future

As the API is released and updated by the Stack Overflow team, we will be able to provide an underlying StackKit implementation for such features.
